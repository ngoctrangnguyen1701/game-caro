1. create token that called 'Play game coin' (PGC), 
use BEP20 of Binance Smart Chain (testnet)

2. before buy token PGC,
+ connect Metamask
+ listen when blockchain's network change or account be changed

3. buy token PGC to play game, 1BNB = 10.000 PGC --> 1 token PGC = 0.0001 BNB
+ before buy PGC, check balance of BNB must be greater than amount of BNB that wil pay
+ limit buy PGC 100 - 10.000 PGC/time

  ++ if balance > 0, next step
    +++ approve all amount of token in balance for 'TokenSwap' contract
    +++ approve success, call methods 'swap' of 'TokenSwap' contract
    +++ swap success, submit to server (transactionHash, paybackToken, paybackTime, address)
  ++ balance = 0, cancel swap token
